my-triangle
===========

This is just a program I wrote for the Rust Trianglethon. It uses OpenGL to draw a spinning triangle in a window. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I'm putting this in the public domain; it's not complicated enough to deserve anything else. Feel free to use it in any way you like.
